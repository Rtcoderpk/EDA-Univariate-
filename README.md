#Purposes of Univariate EDA
1) Understanding Distribution:

Identify the shape of the data distribution (e.g., normal, skewed, uniform).
Determine the frequency of different values or ranges of values within the variable.
2) Central Tendency:

Calculate measures of central tendency such as mean, median, and mode to understand the typical value of the variable.
3) Dispersion and Spread:

Measure the spread or variability of the data using metrics like range, variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range (IQR).
Identify the presence of outliers, which can affect the analysis and modeling.
4) Detecting Outliers:

Identify and understand outliers in the data, which may indicate data entry errors or significant deviations that need further investigation.
5) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Spot missing values, duplicates, and other anomalies that need to be addressed before further analysis or modeling.
6) Informing Further Analysis:

Gain insights that inform more complex multivariate analysis and modeling steps, such as feature selection and transformation.
